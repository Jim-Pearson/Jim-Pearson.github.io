    "### What are the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers?\n",
    "#### Fibonacci\n",
    "The Fibonacci numbers, a.k.a. the Fibonacci sequence, are an ordered sequence of whole numbers starting with the first two values $F_1$ and $F_2$ set equal to zero, and then subsequent values are determined from the $\\fre$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: fre\n",
    "F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the third Fibonacci number is $F_3 = 2$ because $F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1 + 1 =2$, the fourth value is $F_4 = 3$ because $F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 2 + 1 = 3$, the fifth is $F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5$, etc. The first 12 values are:  \n",
    "$ 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144 $\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence can be extended backwards, with $F_0=0$, $F_{-1}=1$, $F_{-2}=-1$, etc.  \n",
    "There is a mathemagical formula for directly calculating any member of the Fibonacci sequence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\right)^n-\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt5}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt5}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems odd or amazing that this messy equation with several $\\sqrt5$s in it would evaluate to whole numbers, but it works.  \n",
    "I'll abbreviate this formula by setting $ \\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2} $ and $ \\pb = \\frac{1-\\sqrt5}{2} $ so that   \n",

    ":label: binet\n",
    "F_n = \\frac{\\phi^n-\\pb^n}{\\sqrt5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lucas\n",
    "The Lucas numbers are similar to the Fibonacci sequence except that the first two values are $L_1 = 1$ and $L_2 = 3$. So the first 12 values are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1,3,4,7,11,18,29,47,76,123,199,322\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are related to the Fibonacci numbers by the equation $ L_n = F_{n+1} + F_{n-1} $. As with the Fibonacci numbers, there is a formula for calculating Lucas numbers directly:  \n",
