# Welcome to Jim Pearson's Page

Some insights regarding Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio are described here. I love math and took an interest in Fibonacci numbers a few years ago. It's unlikely anything here is new, but some of the ideas here I haven't seen elsewhere.

The site is now interactive! Open any of the pages below, and a little rocketship icon will appear on the upper-right. Mouse over it and then click on the Binder option in the pop-up. An interactive version of the page will appear in Jupyter Lab! It might take some time for the server to set everything up for you the first time so be patient. You'll be able to edit and re-run all the code on the page. Binder creates your own copy of my Git repository in a sandbox so you can change whatever want with no consequences. Click on "File" then "Open" to change to another page. Have fun!
